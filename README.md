# Obsolete repo

This was a first attempt to create an SDL2 wrapper in pure Go, using the DLL directly without CGo.

I have used [veandco's repo](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2) in the past so instead of creating my own version with a different API, I decided to join their efforts instead. I am current working on [an API compatible version](https://github.com/gonutz/go-sdl2) of their repo, mirroring what they do in pure Go. This repo here is no longer maintained and will be removed once the other version is complete. I hope to integrate my changes into veandco's repo eventually so that there can be one definitive Go wrapper for SDL2.
